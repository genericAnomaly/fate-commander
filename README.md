# fate-commander

GM tool for creating and managing large numbers of NPCs using the FATE system.

This tool is being designed primarily to simulate a starship crew, but as it develops I will probably work on generalising it more.

An aside, I'm keeping this on Github mostly for convenience and to share it with the couple of coder friends I've got on tumblr (and also to try to learn the github ropes so the history might end up looking kind of messy). Don't expect the code to be perfectly formal, this is for fun, which is why I'm using Processing.

## Attribution

I have no idea what the proper practice for this is so I'm just gonna list stuff off here.
